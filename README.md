# sacProcessing
this is the code i wrote for my batchlor thesis.
it processes a cut down version of sac to convert some recursive functions into faster equivalent with loops.
this was used to formalise and validate a model as a template for implementing this in compilers of functional array languages.

this is **NOT** production software. 


/bin/main.ml is the only relevant file in this repository, the rest is for the development environment.

(this is my first ocaml project, don't expect neat code.)
